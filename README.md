Hello, I am Potatoling2. I will put my random short projects here on my base page.


Currently Uploaded:


Text Scroller

compcode


Ideas:

League Esports Data Formula (separate project: see profile)

Tic-Tac-Toe

Tetris

Explanation:


Text Scroller: A basic program that makes scrolling text in java. Useful for making text based interactive programs feel more fresh. Delay between characters is editable.

compcode: Bad name for a rushed project, couldn't figure out a better way to solve a math problem from rcml so made a quick code to check my answer.

League Esports Data Formula: Use my personal biased metrics to create an "elo" score for various league of legends teams. The goal is to eventually be able to simulate matches and predict winners of tournaments using this. 

Tic-Tac-Toe: Learn how to use visual outputs and more complex java libraries to create a basic game of tic-tac-toe.

Tetris: Create the video game “Tetris” in java, or similar coding program, big project, probably won't happen for a long time :P
