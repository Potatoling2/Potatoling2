Hello, I am Potatoling2. I will put my random short projects here on my base page.


Currently Uploaded:


Text Scroller


Ideas:


Fake Chat Bot

League Esports Data Formula (separate project: see profile)

Octopath COTC Team Builder

Tic-Tac-Toe

Tetris

Explanation:


Text Scroller: A basic program that makes scrolling text in java. Useful for making text based interactive programs feel more fresh. Delay between characters is editable.

Fake Chat Bot: A simple text formula where you can talk to an “AI” endlessly, acting similarly to a chat app.

League Esports Data Formula: Use my personal biased metrics to create an "elo" score for various league of legends teams. The goal is to eventually be able to simulate matches and predict winners of tournaments using this. 

Octopath COTC Team Builder: Create a database of all COTC characters and create characteristics about them. Then have users input their chosen teams and use more biased metrics to tell them whether their team has issues or whatnot.

Tic-Tac-Toe: Learn how to use visual outputs and more complex java libraries to create a basic game of tic-tac-toe.

Tetris: Create the video game “Tetris” in java, or similar coding program, big project, probably won't happen for a long time :P
